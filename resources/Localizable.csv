Tower_Railgun_Description1^This level 1 Railgun provides long-range damage with a little extra area damage.  Place it to pick off units trying to sneak by.^^
Tower_Railgun_Description2^This level 2 Railgun is an excellent tool against sneaky units.  As it can't fire around itself, why not completely surround it with towers?^^
